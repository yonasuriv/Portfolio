## Junior Software Engineering Portfolio

Below is a list of the recommended portfolio a junior software engineer should have.<br>
If you don't like any or you have another one that's not listed here, that's okay.<br>
I will attach the projects I've created to them so you have an idea, feel free to edit them with your own.

## How can I become a Junior Software Developer?

Below is a free-way to become a Junior Software Developer in 6 months, totally free.
What you need to do is to invest heavily in the 3 first certifications dictated on FreeCodeCamp:

1.  [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)  (300 hours)
2.  [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)  (300 hours)
3.  [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)  (300 hours).

We're talking 900 hours, dividing that by 10 hours/day gives us 90 days of intense study. Yes, intense. 

Of course, if you decide to put in 8 hours a day, it may take longer. 900/8 is about 113 days. So it will adapt within 4 months. 

My suggestion is that you divide your time between completing challenges, reading, watching talks, and listening to podcasts or ebooks. This way, you can avoid getting frustrated or bored doing the same thing over and over again.

#### Are there other ways to learn?
Of course, there are a lot of other places you can learn, feel free to!
There are a lot of bootcamps out there that you only have to pay a small amount to enter and then you pay the rest when you find your first job.

Also, E-Learning platforms nowadays are sky-rocketing, without the need for a University Degree.

#### Where can I practice?
-   [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
-   [CodeingGame](https://www.codingame.com/)
-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
-   [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
-   [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)
-   [Interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/fast-track-js/)

### Soft Skills needed
These are definitely the 3 things you must show when creating your portfolio:

1.  **Passion**
2.  **Energy**
3.  **Capacity** (to evolve and learn "alone")

- Check out other projects to see people solving the same problem. <br>
    Getting inspiration from their ideas is not cheating, you can learn a lot by doing it.<br>
    *(Please don't blindly copy code without understanding its meaning)*<br>
- Continuously improve and refine your projects.<br>
- Put yourself in the shoes of the person who is hiring and pay attention to the details that make the difference <br>
    *(This is how you show the 3 things above)*

**There's also a 4th thing**, it's not a soft one, but not less important, **Orthography**.

- Try to write not only clean code, but clearly and without spelling errors.

- You can use the help of third-party applications, such as extensions for your browser or code editor.

*I'll be adding some so you can take a look, meanwhile feel free to search for them on your favorite search engine.*

### FCC Test Suite
FreeCodeCamp Developed this helpful Test Suite.

Simply add the below script section of your after the ending of your body tag on your HTML.

    <script src='https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js'></script>

#### Instructions 
  - Select the project you would  like to complete from the dropdown menu.
  - Click the "RUN TESTS" button to run the tests against the blank pen.
  - Click the "TESTS" button to see the individual test cases. (should all be failing at first)
  - Start coding! As you fulfill each test case, you will see them go from red to green.
  - As you start to build out your project, when tests are failing, you should get helpful errors along the way!

## Roadmap

I highly suggest you follow this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) if you want to adventure by yourself.

**Full-Stack Developer**
-   [Front-End](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
-   [Back-End](https://roadmap.sh/backend)


Please, be sure to finish the Front-End **before** entering in the Back-End, or at least be sure that you have enough knowledge on it. 

#### It is possible to learn Back-End without Front-End?

Yes, it is, although it will be much more complicated, and the hiring managers will most likely reject you.
