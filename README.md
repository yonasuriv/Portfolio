## How can I become a Junior Software Developer?

Below is a free-way to become a Junior Software Developer in 6 months, totally free.
What you need to do is to invest heavily in the 3 first certifications dictated on FreeCodeCamp:

1.  [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)  (300 hours)
2.  [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)  (300 hours)
3.  [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)  (300 hours).

We're talking 900 hours, dividing that by 10 hours/day gives us 90 days of intense study. Yes, intense. 

Of course, if you decide to put in 8 hours a day, it may take longer. 900/8 is about 113 days. So it will adapt within 4 months. 

My suggestion is that you divide your time between completing challenges, reading, watching talks, and listening to podcasts or ebooks. This way, you can avoid getting frustrated or bored doing the same thing over and over again.

#### Are there other ways to learn?
Of course, there are a lot of other places you can learn, feel free to!
There are a lot of bootcamps out there that you only have to pay a small amount to enter and then you pay the rest when you find your first job.

Also, E-Learning platforms nowadays are sky-rocketing, without the need for a University Degree.

#### Where can I practice?
-   [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript)
-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
-   [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
-   [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)
-   [Interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/fast-track-js/)

## Roadmap

I highly suggest you follow this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) if you want to adventure by yourself.

**Full-Stack Developer**
-   [Front-End](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
-   [Back-End](https://roadmap.sh/backend)


Please, be sure to finish the Front-End **before** entering in the Back-End, or at least be sure that you have enough knowledge on it. 

#### It is possible to learn Back-End without Front-End?

Yes, it is, although it will be much more complicated, and the hiring managers will most likely not take you into account.
